# About this repo
This repository contains the code for a project that uses multiple objective Bayesian optimisation (MOBO) to optimise the district heating and cooling system with a borehole thermal energy storage (BTES) system.

The files are structured as follows:

## code/
This directory contains all codes used for doing optimisation for different BTES configurations.

## data/
This directory contains all raw and derived datasets. Further information for each dataset can be found in metadata.txt.

## plot/
This directory contains the figures used in the project, and the code used to produce the plots.
